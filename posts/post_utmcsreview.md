### MAT102: Introduction to Mathematical Proofs
Overhated course. Placeholder text...

### CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science
Nothingburger course. Placeholder text...

### My plans going forward
I'm taking MAT223 and CSC207 at St. George this summer. It's gonna be fun.

### Cutoffs in May 2025
CSC148: 80%
MAT102: 73%
