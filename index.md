## Work experience
### **Audiovisual Team**
**Every Nation** \
Jun 2021 - Present \
I've been doing this one for a while. I do audio visual work here. I've always had a passing interest in photography and videography, which combines well with my love for tech in my activities here.

### **Youth In Policing Initiative**
**Peel Regional Police** \
Jul 2023 - Aug 2023 \
I thought this was pretty fun. It was a nice opportunity to work for the police and get paid as a high schooler, while we got an inside look into parts of their operations the public doesn't normally see.

### **Peer Tutor**
**St. Roch Catholic Secondary School** \
Mar 2022 - Jun 2024 \
I used to work as a tutor for younger students at my school. I taught math, physics, and French.

## Achievements and awards
I'm pretty proud of these, although most of these are from high school.
